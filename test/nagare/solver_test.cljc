  "Lid-driven cavity at Re=100: the PISO loop must reproduce the qualitative Ghia
  centreline signature. We use a coarse grid and a loose band — first-order upwind
  on a coarse mesh is diffusive, so the dip is shallower than the fine-mesh Ghia
  value of -0.21, but the *shape* (a negative underflow in the lower half, rising
  to the lid) is the physics under test."

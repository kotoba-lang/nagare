  "A build-time guard for the library's defining promise: the KERNEL namespaces run
  unchanged on JVM / SCI / ClojureScript / GraalVM / kotoba-WASM. Any JVM-only
  interop (java.*, Integer/, Double/, format, …) in a kernel file would silently
  break that on a JS/WASM host, so it must be reader-conditionalized `#?(:clj …)`.
  The `demo` namespace is excluded — it is a JVM `-main` showcase, not the product.
  (This test itself uses slurp and so runs JVM-side; it lints source text.)"

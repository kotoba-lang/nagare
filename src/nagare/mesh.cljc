  "Unstructured **polyMesh** — the geometric substrate of the finite-volume method.

  OpenFOAM never stores a structured i/j/k grid; it stores a *face list*. Every
  cell is a closed set of flat **faces**; each internal face is shared by exactly
  two cells — an **owner** and a **neighbour** — and each boundary face belongs to
  one cell and one **patch**. This `owner`/`neighbour` addressing is the whole
  trick: a single flat sweep over faces visits every off-diagonal coupling of the
  discrete operator exactly once (owner gets `+flux`, neighbour gets `-flux`),
  which is *why* the conservation laws stay discretely conservative — the flux that
  leaves a cell through a face enters its neighbour byte-for-byte.

  We *build* a 2-D `Nx x Ny` block (unit depth in z) but immediately lower it into
  this unstructured representation, so the operators downstream never assume
  structure — they only ever read `owner`, `neighbour`, face areas/normals and the
  owner->neighbour delta. The geometry of a uniform block is exact (rectangles), so
  there is no discretization error hiding in the mesh itself; that keeps the coarse
  verification meshes trustworthy.

  ## Derived geometry (the finite-volume integrand bookkeeping)
  - **cell volume** `V_P` — area x unit-depth.
  - **face area vector** `Sf = |Sf| n`, with `n` the unit normal pointing *out of
    the owner* (so a positive `U.Sf` is outflow from the owner). For a boundary
    face the normal points out of the domain.
  - **owner->neighbour delta** `d = C_N - C_P` and its magnitude `|d|`, the length
    scale a `laplacian` divides by.
  - **linear interpolation weight** `fx` so that `phi_f = fx phi_P + (1-fx) phi_N`;
    for a uniform block the face bisects the centroid line and `fx = 1/2`.

  Everything below is a pure value (arrays + maps). Operators read it; nothing
  mutates it."

(defn block-mesh
  "Build an `nx` x `ny` rectangular block over `[0,lx] x [0,ly]` (unit depth) and
  return it as an unstructured polyMesh value.

  Cells are numbered `c = j*nx + i` (i fastest). Internal faces are enumerated
  vertical-first (the `+x` faces between (i,j) and (i+1,j)) then horizontal (the
  `+y` faces between (i,j) and (i,j+1)); owner is always the lower-index cell so
  `Sf` points owner->neighbour. Four boundary **patches** are returned in the
  order `:left :right :bottom :top`, each carrying its own primitive arrays.

  Returns a map of primitive arrays (hot path) plus a few convenience vectors:
